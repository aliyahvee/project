        <p>Recently, Best Buy announced that CDs will no longer be sold in their stores as of July 1st.  With streaming and digital albums on the rise, it seems that CDs may be losing its place with music consumers. Yet, that isn’t the case. CDs aren’t flying off the shelves anymore, but they’re still hanging in there. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), CDs having been outselling digital albums, digital singles, and vinyl singles.</p>

        <p>Matthew Bass, an expert in Data Analysis at RIAA, said that CDs have been the major format of the 90s and doesn’t think that there’s ever been a time where digital has sold more than physical.</p>

        <p>In response to Best Buy’s recent announcement, Bass said that there are a lot of factors that play into CD sales. “We think it’s kind of a story of retail in general. Consumption is changing but it’s not completely indicative. I think there’s larger things at play. We think it’s changes in consumer behavior,” he said.</p>

        <p>Best Buy could not be reached for comment.</p>
