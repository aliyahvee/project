        <h1>Music Matters: Vinyl records are exploding in the music market, but what about CDs?</h1>
        <p> <b> By Shari Straker and Aliyah Veal </b> </p>

        <p> CDs trickled onto the scene in 1983 when Fred Cohen, 72 opened his Jazz Record Center, but at the time the store only sold vinyl records. </p>
        <p> “It took us a few years to realize CDs were here to stay,” said Cohen.</p>

        <p> While some big retail stores such as Best Buy will discontinue selling CDs because of declining sales, smaller stores like Cohen’s are doing well.</p>

        <p> Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at Global Retail Data, said that revenue sales are a factor in the company’s decision to remove CDs from their stores. He also said that the company is cutting back on a category that isn’t popular anymore.</p>

        <p> CDs aren’t flying off the shelves like they used to in the age of digital downloads and streaming services, but they aren’t extinct. Data from Nielsen revealed that physical albums are beating digital album sales by 36.7 million units in 2017.</p>

        <p> “It is true that physical albums are doing better than digital albums, but that’s mainly because people don’t really buy albums digitally – they tend to download individual songs,” Saunders said.</p>

        <p> Yet, CDs are still prospering in local record shops. Data from IBIS World Industry Report showed that 200 million albums were sold in the local market, while CDs, record tapes and audio books make up 23.9 percent of the market.</p>

        <p> Saunders said record shops, like Cohen’s, have survived over the years because they are knowledgeable, have good customer service, and loyal customers who are collectors and consistently purchase quality music.</p>

        <p> Consumers are loyal to vinyl records because it’s more of an experience than any other form of music. </p>
        <p> Pete Crisp, 60, loves the nostalgia that’s attached to playing a record on his record player. “Putting a record on is quite a physical thing, because you only get like 20 minutes of music,” he said. “You have to get up, [and] turn it over.” </p>

          <div id="section" class="spot" data-description="According to Nielsen, 102.9 million physical albums were sold in 2017. Sales are down by 16.5% from 2016."></div>

        <p class="caption">Fred Cohen, owner of Jazz Record Center, said the CDs in his store sell very well and he is always ordering new music and reissues old music.</p>

        <p> Cohen attributes the success of the store, which celebrated 35 years since its opening on April 1, to loyal consumers and Jazz lovers.</p>
        <p> “I got people who are proud of the fact that they were here 35 years ago or 25 years ago,” he said. </p>

        <p> As the market continues to change, Jazz connoisseur and record collector Fred Cohen doesn’t know where music will be headed next.</p>
        <p> “I just can’t imagine anything beyond a CD. I guess 35 years ago we would have said the same thing about this,” he said. “Digitization is what it is. What else could there possibly be except brain implants?”</p>
